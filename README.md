# Practical Immutability in Java with Immutables and Vavr

A set of 2 **presentations** and a **complete kata** for learning about **immutability in practice**.

## Presentations

* `practical-immutability-1.md` contains the 1st presentation about:
  * introduction to immutability,
  * introduction to _Immutables_ and _Vavr_,
  * immutable objects with _Immutables_,
  * immutable collections and options with _Vavr_,
  * practical applicability with common technologies.
* `practical-immutability-2.md` contains the 2nd presentation about:
  * immutable variables,
  * expressions,
  * Algebraic Data Types (ADT),
  * pattern matching,
  * opening to functional programming.
* `src/main/java/practicalimmutability/presentation` contains sample code and experiments related to both presentations.

## Robot Kata

* `immutable-bender-kata.md` contains **instructions** for the robot kata.
* `src/main/java/practicalimmutability/kata/robot` contains the kata.
* `src/test/java/practicalimmutability/kata/robot` contains the tests for the kata.
