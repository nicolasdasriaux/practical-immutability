# Immutable Bender, Episode 1

This kata is about implementing a CodinGame exercise called **Bender, Episode 1**

## Instructions

The instructions can be found at the following location and are the sole property of CodinGame:
https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/bender-episode-1

## Setup

* **IntelliJ** (Community edition is enough) is recommended as it features much more reliable **Annotation Processor** support compared to **Eclipse**.
* **JDK** should be at least JDK 8.

Once project opened, you will have to enable annotation processor support:

## Recommended Implementation Steps

1) Complete `Direction` implementation
2) Complete `Position` implementation
3) Complete `Tile` implementation
4) Complete `CityMap` implementation
5) Complete `Robot` implementation
6) Complete `Scene` implementation
7) Optionally start playing with `RobotApp` application to help visualize what happens
8) Complete `SceneTracking` implementation
9) Complete `TrackedScene` implementation
10) Play with `RobotApp` application to help visualize what happens
11) Optionally finish up the implementation by following the last steps of CodingGame instructions
